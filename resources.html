    <h2> <u> 10 Ways to Help Endangered Animals </u> <h2>
      <p>
	Often we get lost in the thought process that we, as one person, cannot make a substantial difference in such a vast world, but taking small steps is better than standing still. Here are some easy ways to help the world around you!
    </p>
<h4> 1. Eat Seafood/Meat Sustainably </h4>
<p> Going vegetarian or vegan can seem daunting or impossible, but taking small steps towards ethical eating can make changes too!
</p>
<h4> 2. Buy sustainable products </h4>
<p> Buying sustainable goods and services can reduce your carbon emissions. Many companies that most of our daily products come from contribute to most of the pollution and lobby against cleaning up their act! You can do your part in fighting them by not buying their products or raising awareness to their wrong doings.
</p>
<h4> 3. Clean Up After Yourself (at the beach and everywhere) </h4>
<p>When you go to the beach or just out in the world make sure you are cleaning up your trash and disposing of it in the proper receptacle. If you see trash on the ground pick that up too!
</p>
<h4>4. Grow native plants</h4>
<p>Even the plants in your backyard or around your town need a place to live and they might be in danger of losing it. By planting local species you are giving the animals and insects a safe home and reliable food source (and promoting biodiversity!).
</p>
<h4>5. Consider Your Chemicals </h4>
<p> Everything from your hair products to pesticides get into the water or affect your soil. Never dump chemicals or pharmaceuticals down the drain or in open water. If an animal eats a plant with chemicals on it they become contaminated and so does the food chain to follow.
</p>
<h4> 6. Reduce personal footprint </h4>
<p>Reduce your personal footprint. Drive less, walk more.  Support better public transport, use biodegradable products, consume responsibly, and eat whole food from your farmers market.
</p>
<h4>7. Recycle</h4>
<p>Recycling reduces the need for extracting, refining and processing raw materials all of which create air and water pollution. As recycling saves energy it also reduces greenhouse gas emissions, which helps to tackle climate change. Check out what you can recycle in your town!
</p>
<h4>8. Volunteer locally</h4>
<p>There are countless local organizations that need volunteers! Whether itâ€™s a beach cleanup, at an animal shelter, or any other form of volunteering! A quick google search can tell you how to get involved with your local community.
</p>
<h4>9. Support conservation charities</h4>
<p>Below are some charities that do great work for conservation efforts and there are so many ways to support them! You can volunteer your time or can donate in many different ways!
</p>
<h4>10. Inform others</h4>
<p>Share this page and the many others that are informing and raising awareness about animal endangerment!</p>
